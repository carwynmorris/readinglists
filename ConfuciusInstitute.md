Confucius Institute Lit
=======

What are Confucius Institutes? We are trying to figure this out, the articles here include academic articles on Confucius Institutes (CI), journalistic reporting, blog posts, other artefacts as well as some reports from those who have attempted to interact with CI's in their institutions.

What is 996?
---


What can I do?
---

- Update this [list](blacklist/blacklist.md) with evidence to help every worker.  
- Add this [badge](externals/instruction.md) to your project to support 996.ICU.  
- License your awesome projects with the [Anti 996 License](LICENSE).  
- Add proposals to give advice about the development of 996.ICU.
- Go home at 6 pm without feeling sorry.


Principles and purposes
---


Proposals
---
A proposal is a document accepted by 996.ICU.  
Typically, a proposal should outline a solution or suggestion about the development of the project and community.  
For more details, please read the [proposal template](proposal/proposal_template.md) document.  

To help the development of 996.ICU, you can do several things base on proposals.

- Read the accepted proposals and try to improve them.
- Take actions according to the accepted proposals.
- Give your own proposals with a PR following the proposal format.


Expanding influence
---

Please feel free to [translate 996.ICU's contents](i18n/i18n.md), adjust the format, add some contents or fix grammatical errors. Please note that adding too many translations is getting off the track.


Community powers
---

 - [955.WLB](https://github.com/formulahendry/955.WLB) is a repo that maintains a whitelist of 955 work–life balanced companies. It promotes people to flee 996 and join 955.

 - [996.LAW](https://github.com/Y1ran/996.Law) is a repo that collects useful information about cases between employees and enterprise.

 - [996.LIST](https://github.com/fengT-T/996_list) is a repo of a rank list of 996 companies and 955 companies.

 - [996.Leave](https://github.com/623637646/996.Leave) encourage & introduce working overseas.


Where are the issues?
---

Even with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.
So I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.
